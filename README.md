#Emacs Config Files#

My .emacs file and other emacs config files I use.

##Notes##

###jslint###
This takes from a few different posts as I couldn't get it working following them exactly

1. Install node ```brew install node```
2. Get node jslint ```sudo npm install -g jslint```
3. Add jslint to PATH ```PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/jslint/bin```
4. Get flymake-cursor.el ```curl http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/flymake-cursor.el > ~/.elisp/flymake-mode.el```
5. Edit .emacs file ```see .emacs file in this repo```
